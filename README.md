I'm a junior web developer with a solid foundation in full-stack web development, acquired during an intensive course at Coding Bootcamp Praha in 2023. My primary focus is front-end development. I am proficient in React.js, JavaScript, and CSS/SASS, but I am also skilled in PHP, Laravel, and MySQL, which allows me to work with the back-end. I'm passionate about continuous learning and expanding my skill set.

👩‍💻 Actively looking for new opportunities.
